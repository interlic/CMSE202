    "[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is an example of cellular automation which was devised by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game is played on a rectangular grid of \"cells\". Each cell is adjacent to up to eight neighbor cells. Initially, each cell is either alive or dead. At each timestep, the states (alive/dead) of the cells update simultaneously according to the following rules:\n",

Also, the three living cells in the top right area appear to alternate between being in a vertical line and a horizontal line, and the six living cells in the bottom left area don't move. If that doesn't describe what your animation does, you may need to debug your `Cell()` class code in Question 2.1."

    "&#9989; **Question 2.4 (11 points)**: Now that you've gotten a basic animation going, let's explore the behavior of some patterns in the Game of Life. The above simulation included the \"glider\", \"blinker\", and \"beehive\" patterns. The GameOfLifePatterns.py file includes functions to add five other patterns to an array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since these patterns turn out to be a bit more complicated than the three in the simulation above, let's look at each of these patterns one at a time. For each of these five patterns (\"pentadecathalon\", \"spaceship\", \"generator\", \"diehard\", and \"R\"), create a simulation by doing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a numpy array of zeros of size $60 \\times 60$ or bigger.\n",
    "2. Use the corresponding function to add just that one pattern to the array. \n",
    "3. Run the simulation for at least $200$ iterations.\n",
    "4. Briefly (1-3 sentences) describe what you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're asking you to do five **separate** simulations, but with very similar setups, you can either (1) write code in the cell below in a way that it is easy for someone to switch between simulations or (2) create a different code cell for each simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may want to read the docstrings in the GameOfLifePatterns.py file to understand how these functions work. You were also provided examples in the code for Question 2.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `row` and `col` arguments of the functions specify the location for the top-left corner. If you try to add a pattern in a location such that any part of the pattern goes outside the bounds for the array, you'll get an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Most of these patterns are best placed in the middleish of the array, but the \"generator\" pattern is a bit cooler if you place it in the opposite corner as the direction you specify (e.g. top-left if `dir='SE'`, top-right if `dir='SW'`, bottom-left if `dir='NE'`, bottom-right if `dir='NW'`).

    "In this part of the homework, we will look at a dataset which contains the final score of all NCAA football games between Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams during the 2023 regular season. We will model this data as a directed graph where each team is a node, and for each game, there is a directed edge from the winning team to the losing team. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if we only had four teams (Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D) and Team A beat Team B, Team A beat Team C, Team B beat Team C, and Team C beat Team D, our directed graph would look like this: \n",

Here's a pretty graph that someone else made with a similar but different dataset. <img src=\"http://blogs.acu.edu/coba/files/2016/12/ncaa-football-diagram-490x376.jpg\" width=400px align=\"center\" alt=\"Image credit: https://blogs.acu.edu/\">\n",

    "For those of you who don't know much about football or even sports in general, don't panic. No intricate sports knowledge is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical note for sports fans: The dataset you will be using only include games where both teams are in the FBS. So for example, the game between `\"Michigan State\"` and `\"Richmond\"` is not in the dataset since `\"Richmond\"` is an FCS team."

    "&#9989;  **Question 3.5 (5 points)**: There are over 100 FBS teams, but each team only gets to play a few of the other teams. However, fans still want to be able to argue that their team is better than another team, even if their team didn't play and beat that other team. One way to do this is using the \"transitive property\". For example, if Team A beat Team B and Team B beat Team C, then Team A's fans can say \"Since Team A is better than Team B, and Team B is better than Team C, Team A must be better than Team C.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a perfectly logical argument since there is some luck in sports, and so the \"better\" team doesn't always win. Furthermore, if Team A beats Team B, Team B beats Team C, and Team C beats Team A, then the fanbases of all three teams can argue that their team is better than a team they lost to. Of course, arguments about sports are often not based on logic. :P\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this \"transitive property\"-based reasoning by using more intermediate teams. In general, if Team $A_0$ beat Team $A_1$, Team $A_1$ beat Team $A_2$, ..., and Team $A_{n-1}$ beat Team $A_n$, then Team $A_0$'s fans can claim that Team $A_0$ is better than Team $A_n$. Obviously, the more intermediate teams you need, the less credible the argument sounds. The website https://www.myteamisbetterthanyourteam.com/ helps fans find a shortest path of comparisons to claim that their team is better than someone else's team. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do this**: Our goal is to make a function that takes in the directed graph that you created along with two strings called `my_team` and `their_team`, and then prints a sequence of statements of the form \"[TEAM NAME] beat [TEAM NAME]\" which can be used to argue that `my_team` is better than `their team` (assuming such a sequence exists). To do this, the function will first use the `shortest_path()` method to generate a list of teams $[A_0,A_1,\\ldots,A_n]$ which forms the shortest path from `my_team` to `their_team`. Then, it will iterate through this list to print out the sequence of statements \"Team $A_i$ beat Team $A_{i+1}$\"."
